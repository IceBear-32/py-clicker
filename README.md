# py-clicker
Oh wel well, this is just an autoclicker, what did you expect?
You can setup the needed things in it like the right click or left click toggle key and the click interval (inverse of clicks per second (CPS). i.e, 1/CPS)

Uses `tkinter` for the gui and `pyautogui` for click simulation

But the drawback here is, python is interpreted so this doesn't accurately simulate clicks, it takes some time to execute the lines.
This is a fun project, you might learn something so that's fine :)

That's everything thank you üê¨
